Summary of Bugs Fixed

1. Invalid API Key & Setup
Bug: Application hung on startup due to placeholder API key.
Fix: Added .env file for secure API key management and updated setup docs.

2. Faulty Agent & Task Logic
Bug: All analysis tasks were assigned to a single agent.
Fix: Re-assigned tasks to correct specialist agents (financial_analyst, investment_advisor, risk_assessor).

3. Incorrect CrewAI Syntax
Bug: Used tool instead of tools in agent definitions, breaking file-reading.
Fix: Corrected to tools, ensuring proper integration.

4. Ineffective AI Prompts

Fix: Rewritten to be professional, specific, and data-driven.
